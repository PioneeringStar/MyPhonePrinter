# ProjectOno

A community-driven, cross-platform, Mono-based application for the ONO 3D Printer.

The intention of this project is to improve and extend the reach, user experience, and functionality of the ONO 3D Printer.
There is concern around the stability of the existing (or lack of) official platform and support. 
We, the community, believe we can do better!

## Support

This project will start with support for iOS, Android, and Windows base mobile devices.
There is intent to keep the code base open for extending this support to desktop machines as well.

## Functionality

This product is just getting set up so please check back often to see its progress.
