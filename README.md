# Projectono

A community-driven, cross-platform, Mono-based application for mobile-driven resin printers.

This project was inspired by the ONO (OLO) 3D printer and is being designed as an open platform for the emerging mobile-driven resin-based printer market. The intention is to create an extensible, light-weight platform that can be used as a simple interface for ONO and other printers in its market.

*NOTE: Projectono is not affiliated with ONO. Projectono is an independent, open-source, community-driven project.*

## Support

This project will start with support for iOS, Android, and Windows base mobile devices. Limitations within Xamarin dictate the minimum Android version to be 4.4 with API 19.

There is intent to keep the code base open for extending this support to desktop machines as well.

## Functionality

This product is just getting set up so please check back often to see its progress.
