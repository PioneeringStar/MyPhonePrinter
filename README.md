Project to display Sliced images for the ONO mobile phone printer

This project intends to create a UWP/Xamarin app for displaying images generated by a third party slicer. At some point it may do the 
slicing itself, but the immediate requirement is to get the ONO printer running on Windows Phone. Cross compilation to iPhone and Android
are welcome.

This project only exists because of a lack of support from the ONO team itself for Windows phone. However, because the code relies on
a third-party slicer, it means that it also decouples the printer from the ONO application cloud. It also opens the printer to using
third-party resins, such as those from Photocentric in the UK.
